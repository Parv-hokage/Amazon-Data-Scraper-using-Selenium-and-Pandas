# üíª Amazon Product Data Scraper (OOP with Selenium & Pandas)

This project is a robust web scraper designed to extract detailed product information from Amazon's
search resultsand individual product pages. It utilizes **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and industry-standard 
Python libraries to handle dynamic content and structure data efficiently.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Object-Oriented Design (OOP):** Logic is separated into two classes (`Scrapper` and `Info_Bot`) for modularity and easy maintenance.
* **Dynamic Content Handling:** Uses **Selenium WebDriver** to interact with JavaScript-rendered pages (essential for Amazon).
* **Anti-Detection Measures:** Configured with headless mode, a custom User-Agent, and specific flags to mitigate common bot-detection challenges.
* **Data Extraction:** Fetches key metrics including **ASINs**, **Prices**, **Brands**, **Ratings**, and **Review Counts**.
* **Data Output:** Structures the scraped data using **Pandas** and saves it to a clean CSV file.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need **Python** installed on your system, and the following libraries:
Ensure you have a browser installed (like Chrome) as Selenium will control it.
```bash
pip install selenium pandas
(The script generates an amazon_products.csv file in the project folder. An example of the structured data output
 is available in the example_output.csv file in this repository, shown in part below:)

### Project Structure

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `main.py` | The main execution script. It initializes the scraper, runs the workflow, and uses Pandas to process and save the final data. |
| `page_scrapers.py` | Contains the **`Info_Bot`**  |
| `URL_scrapper.py` | Contains the **`Scrapper`** |

## üìà Output Data Sample

The scraper structures the collected information into an `amazon_products.csv` file. A sample of the output data is shown below:

| Product Name | ASIN | Price | Brand | Rating | Number of Reviews | URL |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **XMART INDIA Drawer Organizers...** | B08BVV3FVQ | 219 | XMART INDIA | 4.2 | 1,834 ratings | https://www.amazon.in/XMART-INDIA... |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note (Stability)

As a web scraping tool, this project relies on the current structure (HTML/CSS selectors) of the Amazon website.
 **Amazon frequently updates its site layout.** If Amazon changes its page structure, the selectors used in the `Scrapper`
and `Info_Bot` classes may become invalid, rendering the script temporarily useless until the selectors are updated.
